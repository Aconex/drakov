We have setup a google group to assist with the answering of questions any users of Drakov may have.

## MSON Support via Attribute elements

Since version 0.1.12 MSON support is now provided.


## Note on Dependencies

You will need to have `g++` and `make` installed on your system so `npm install` can compile the [Snow Crash](https://github.com/apiaryio/snowcrash) library.


## Installation instructions

`npm install -g drakov`


## Running

`drakov -f <glob expression to your md files> -s <comma delimited list of static file paths> -p <server port>`


**Argument Notes:**

- Glob expression is required
- If a list of static file paths are provided, then Drakov will proxy the static files
- Server port is optional and defaults to **3000**
- CORS headers are sent by default, you need to use the --disableCORS switch/property


## Running with configuration file

`drakov --config config.js`

**Important**

This mode of operation will load your configuration from a Javascript file that must export an object of arguments as 
supported in the [arguments module](https://github.com/Aconex/drakov/blob/master/lib/arguments/arguments.js).

All command line arguments aside from `--config` will be ignored, and the defaults will be merged in.


## API discovery

`drakov -f <glob expression to your md files> --discover`

Enableds the `/drakov` endpoint, which lists all the available endpoints currently being served by Drakov


## Examples with command line arguments

With only a glob expression

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md"`

With glob expression and single static path

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" -s "../path/to/static/files"`

With glob expression and multiple static paths (must be comma delimited with no spaces)

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" -s "../path/to/static/files" -s "../second/path/to/static/files"`

With glob expression and static path that has a specific mount point

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" -s "../path/to/static/files=/www/path"`

With glob expression and static path that has a specific mount point with different path mount delimiter

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" -s "../path/to/static/files:/www/path" -d ":"`

With glob expression and specified server port

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" -p 4007`

When running drakov and binding to a public IP

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --public`

## CORS Header

By default a CORS header is sent, you can disable it with the --disableCORS switch.

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --disableCORS`

## Automatic response to OPTIONS requests

When you run server for testing API on different port than your app it's handy to allow cross origin resource sharing (CORS). 
For this to work you need also to listen on every route for OPTIONS requests.

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --autoOptions`

## Run on Public Interface

By default Drakov only binds to localhost, to run on the public IP interface use the --public switch.

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --public`

## SSL Support

To enable SSL you must provide both key and certificate. Use parameters --sslKeyFile and --sslCrtFile to specify the path to your key and certificate files.
Once SSL is enabled Drakov will only respond to HTTPS requests.

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --sslKeyFile="./ssl/server.key" --sslCrtFile="./ssl/server.crt"`

## Stealth Mode

In some cases you may wish to suppress the logging output of Drakov. To do so, run is with the `--stealthmode` options.

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --stealthmode`

## Response Delay

In some case you may want to force Drakov to delay sending a response. To do this simple use the `--delay` argument followed by a number (ms).

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --delay 2000`

## Allow Methods Header

For HTTP methods such as DELETE, you may want Drakov to return them in the appropriate methods allow header. You can do this using the `--method` argument

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --method DELETE`

`drakov -f "../com/foo/contracts/*.md" --method DELETE --method OPTIONS`


## Using as a Node.js module

    var drakov = require('drakov');
    
    var argv = {
        sourceFiles: 'path/to/files/**.md',
        serverPort: 3000,
        staticPaths: [
            '/path/to/static/files',
            '/another/path/to/static/files',
            '/path/to/more/files=/mount/it/here'
        ],
        stealthmode: true,
        disableCORS: true,
        sslKeyFile: '/path/to/ssl/key.key',
        sslCrtFile: '/path/to/ssl/cert.crt',
        delay: 2000,
        method: ['DELETE','OPTIONS']
    };
    
    drakov.run(argv, function(){
        // started Drakov
        drakov.stop(function() {
            // stopped Drakov
        });
    });


## Using as an Express middleware

Due to protagonist parsing being async, we need to setup the middleware with an init function

    var drakovMiddleware = require('drakov').middleware;

    var argv = {
        sourceFiles: 'path/to/files/**.md',
        serverPort: 3000,
        staticPaths: [
            '/path/to/static/files',
            '/another/path/to/static/files',
            '/path/to/more/files=/mount/it/here'
        ],
        stealthmode: true,
        disableCORS: true,
        sslKeyFile: '/path/to/ssl/key.key',
        sslCrtFile: '/path/to/ssl/cert.crt',
        delay: 2000,
        method: ['DELETE','OPTIONS']
    };

    var app = express();
    drakovMiddleware.init(app, argv, function(err, middlewareFunction) {
        if (err) {
            throw err;
        }
        app.use(middlewareFunction);
        app.listen(argv.serverPort);
    });

## FAQ

**Q:** If I have multiple requests/responses on the same API endpoint, which response will I get?

**A:** Drakov will respond first with any responses that have a JSON schema with the first response matching the request body for that API endpoint. You can request a specific response by adding a `Prefer` header to the request in the form `Prefer:status=XXX` where `XXX` is the status code of the desired response.  See [issue #88](https://github.com/Aconex/drakov/issues/88) for details.


**Q:** If I have multiple responses on a single request, which response will I get?

**A:** Drakov will respond with the first response.


**Q:** Drakov is too loud (outputting too much logging), can I turn off request and API responses?

**A:** You can suppress all but the startup output of Drakov with `--stealthmode`.


## CONTRIBUTING

Pull requests with patches for fixes and enhancements are very welcome. We have a few requirements that will help us to quickly assess your contributions.

If you have any ideas or questions you are welcome to post an issue.

### Code conventions
* Setup your editor to use the `.editorconfig` and `.jshintrc` files included in the project
* We use 4 spaces for tabs
* Most of the style issues should be resolve as long as you run `npm test` and run against the jshinting rules
* We prefer readability over compact code

### Logging in your code
* Include the `lib/logger` module and use `logger.log()`, this allows your logging be properly disabled in Drakov's stealth mode
* Always have a type qualifier in square brackets in from of your message in white, `logger.log('[TYPE]'.white`, 'Something is happening');`
* We don't have any guidelines for how to log, except that you should have your type a different colour from your actual message (better logging is in our roadmap)

### Functionality that adds CLI arguments
* Make sure you add the new argument property to the `yargsConfigOptions` object in the [arguments module](https://github.com/Aconex/drakov/blob/master/lib/arguments.js#L3)

### Middleware functionality
* For functionality that does something with the request object add code to the [request module](https://github.com/Aconex/drakov/blob/master/lib/middleware/request.js)
* For functionality that does something with the response object add code to the [response module](https://github.com/Aconex/drakov/blob/master/lib/middleware/response.js)

### Testing
* If your contribution deals with API Blueprint request/response behaviour add an example into an existing or new markdown file in the `test/example/md` directory
* Always add a test in `test/api` for request/response behaviour tests, or `test/unit` if it is a unit test
* All test specification files must end in `-test.js`
* Always run `npm test` before you submit your build request
